TicTacToe is a simple re-write of the classic game in C++.

To Build & Install:
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

This project was never finished. Having sat idle for the last nine
years, it's time to archive it. It's possible it will be forked, or
ported over to another language in the future. But I don't forsee
that happening with this particular code base. It was a fun project
at the time, learned a lot, got me through a couple months out of
work. Preserve the history.
